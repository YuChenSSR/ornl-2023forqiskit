Quantum Error Suppression and Mitigation, IBM Qiskit Runtime, and Dynamic Circuits

## Overview
Getting started with Quantum Error Suppression and Mitigation, IBM Qiskit Runtime, and Dynamic Circuits

In this workshop, we will focus on several quantum error suppression and mitigation methods, namely zero noise extrapolation (ZNE), Pauli twirling (PT), dynamical decoupling (DD), and measurement error mitigation (MEM). With a step-by-step process, we will show how to transform and execute a circuit using Qiskit, and post-process results to apply the suppression and mitigation methods.

In the later half of the workshop, we will demonstrate IBM Qiskit Runtime and discuss how end-users can leverage runtime “session” and built-in error suppression and mitigation methods to run their applications on real quantum hardware from IBM.

Finally, we will end with a demonstration of “dynamic circuits” and show how it can unlock new capabilities.
